# XUUnity Light Unity MCP Continuation

Date: `2026-05-22`
Status: `active continuation note`

## Current Baseline

This service is past the design-only stage.

It now has:
- a working stdio MCP server
- an editor-only Unity bridge
- capability probing and gating
- compile and test validation
- compact status summaries with bridge stabilization output
- play mode control
- Game View configure and screenshot support
- asynchronous scenario automation with persisted results
- host-side startup helpers with fail-fast policy for interactive editor startup
- lifecycle-reset recovery by `request_id`
- explicit operator-facing split between transport outcome and Unity operation outcome
- compile-first public post-change validation ordering
- public retro guidance for operator-facing lifecycle and transport failures
- summary-first token discipline for high-churn request paths
- same-project editor launch-in-progress reuse to avoid spawning a second Unity
  instance while an editor open is already in flight
- batch progress heartbeat JSONL sidecars for long-running batch helpers
- generic artifact probe summaries for ZIP/APK and file/text checks
- tracked workspace side-effect accounting around batch helpers
- project-defined hook summary promotion in compact scenario summaries
- operator verdicts for confirmed lifecycle reclassification recovery

The public `xuunity` protocol layer also now understands validation-lane
selection.

## What Is Already Implemented

External server:
- minimal stdio MCP layer
- `initialize`
- `tools/list`
- `tools/call`
- local diagnostics helpers
- `open-editor`
- `ensure-ready`
- `request-editor-quit`
- `restore-editor-state`
- `request-status-summary`
- `request-final-status`
- `request-scenario-results-list`
- `request-scenario-result-latest`
- additive request-scoped `structured_timing` and `artifact_manifest` on
  successful same-host editor responses and `request-final-status`
- host-local package-source mode switching:
  - `devmode`
  - `prodmode`
- approved closed-project batch validation helpers:
  - `batch-compile`
  - `batch-compile-matrix`
  - `batch-build-config-compile-matrix`
  - `batch-editmode-tests`
  - `batch-build-player`
  - `artifact-probe`

Unity bridge:
- heartbeat state
- request pump
- capability probe
- capability gating
- status and health operations
- compile validation
- edit-mode test execution
- console tail
- scene snapshot
- play mode control
- Game View configure and screenshot
- scenario validation
- asynchronous scenario runs
- persisted scenario results

Scenario second-wave steps:
- `compile_player_scripts`
- `tests_run_editmode`
- `game_view_configure`
- `project_defined_hook`

Public reusable smoke assets:
- `templates/scenarios/`
- `templates/smoke/run_package_self_tests.sh`
- `templates/smoke/run_post_change_validation.sh`
- `templates/smoke/run_smoke_suite.sh`
- `templates/smoke/run_playmode_verdict_recovery_proof_suite.sh`
- `DEVMODE_VALIDATION.md`

Package self-test assemblies:
- `com.xuunity.light-mcp.Editor.Tests`
- `com.xuunity.light-mcp.PlayMode.Tests`
- default category: `XUUnity.MCP.SelfTest`
- quick categories: `XUUnity.MCP.Fast`, `XUUnity.MCP.Scene`,
  `XUUnity.MCP.GameObject`, `XUUnity.MCP.Lifecycle`,
  `XUUnity.MCP.Coroutine`

MCP devmode validation closeout:
- after executable-code changes to this MCP host/server/package, follow
  `DEVMODE_VALIDATION.md`
- project-specific validation is additive and does not replace
  `templates/smoke/run_package_self_tests.sh --mode all`

Transport defaults:
- new project setup writes `transport: tcp_loopback` to
  `Library/XUUnityLightMcp/config/bridge_config.json`
- `file_ipc` remains an explicit fallback/compatibility transport

Latest applied retro:
- `../archive/retros/2026-05-15_playmode_verdict_recovery_and_single_project_launch_retro.md`

Day-to-day readiness:
- suitable for same-host status, refresh, compile, EditMode, PlayMode, package
  self-test, and scenario workflows
- use `request-playmode-set --action exit` for PlayMode cleanup
- use `restore-editor-state` only for host-opened editor closeout
- use `ensure-ready --open-editor` as the normal startup/reuse path
- do not manually retry `open-editor` while a Unity splash/open is already in
  progress for the same project

## Important Runtime Files

Inside the target Unity project:

- `Library/XUUnityLightMcp/config/bridge_config.json`
- `Library/XUUnityLightMcp/state/bridge_state.json`
- `Library/XUUnityLightMcp/state/capabilities_report.json`
- `Library/XUUnityLightMcp/inbox/`
- `Library/XUUnityLightMcp/outbox/`
- `Library/XUUnityLightMcp/compile/`
- `Library/XUUnityLightMcp/captures/`
- `Library/XUUnityLightMcp/scenarios/active_run.json`
- `Library/XUUnityLightMcp/scenarios/results/`
- `Library/XUUnityLightMcp/logs/`

## Key Decisions

- editor-only package
- disabled by default
- removable with minimal project residue
- no `ProjectSettings` mutation
- no runtime asmdef
- no broad define mutation
- compile checks should use Unity APIs, not platform switching
- version-sensitive features should be probed and gated
- Game View persistence must be opt-in, not default
- interactive startup should fail fast on compile and package blockers instead of hanging on heartbeat waits

## Validation Lane Model

The shared public `xuunity` core now has a canonical lane model:

- `interactive_mcp`
- `batch_compile`
- `scenario`

Relevant public files:
- `../../../../Modules/XUUnity/knowledge/validation_lanes.md`
- `../../../../Modules/XUUnity/tasks/start_session.md`
- `../../../../Modules/XUUnity/tasks/validation_plan.md`
- `../../../../Modules/XUUnity/skills/tests/unity_test_runner_workflow.md`
- `../../../AI_PROTOCOL_HANDBOOK.md`

Meaning:
- do not re-open the old question of whether shell compile, MCP, and scenario
  automation are equivalent
- lane selection is now part of the protocol contract
- new work should extend that model rather than inventing another validation-path taxonomy
- compile and deterministic EditMode tests may now use an approved closed-project
  `batch_compile` lane, but Play Mode and scene-observation work still require
  `interactive_mcp`

## What A New Chat Should Check First

1. Unity version for the consumer project
2. whether the package is installed through Git or local embedding
3. whether the bridge is enabled
4. `bridge_state.json`
5. `capabilities_report.json`
6. `unity.status` or `request-status-summary`
7. `unity.capabilities.get`
8. `unity.health.probe`
9. if a request crossed lifecycle churn and the `request_id` is known,
   `request-final-status <request_id>`
10. if the wrapper stalled before surfacing a usable `request_id`,
    `request-latest-status --operation <operation>`
11. prefer compact scenario or batch summaries before raw result polling or raw
    log inspection
12. if a same-project Unity open is in progress, wait for `ensure-ready` or run
    `project-discovery-report`; do not start a second editor instance

Mini-playbook after wrapper churn:

1. do not retry the original operation yet
2. check whether the wrapper already emitted a `request_submitted` acknowledgement
   - if it emitted `request_not_submitted`, do not search for request recovery
     yet; recover bridge/editor health first
3. run `request-status-summary --project-root <project>`
4. if the `request_id` is known, run:
   `request-final-status --project-root <project> --request-id <id>`
5. if the `request_id` is not known, run:
   `request-latest-status --project-root <project> --operation <operation>`
6. if the recovered request completed, use that disposition and continue
7. for `unity.tests.run_playmode`, read `test_verdict`,
   `result_payload_source`, counts, first failures, progress, timeout
   classification, and cleanup guidance; wrapper `completion_status=ok` alone
   is not a PlayMode pass
8. only retry after the compact recovery step says the original operation did
   not complete
9. if the original failure was `tests_busy`, prefer
   `request-latest-status --operation unity.tests.run_editmode` or
   `request-latest-status --operation unity.tests.run_playmode` before starting
   a second test run
10. for lifecycle-reset recovery, base retry decisions on structured JSON truth
   such as `recommended_next_action`, `result_trust_class`, and
   `bridge_stabilization.safe_to_retry`, not only shell exit behavior
11. if `operator_verdict.status=confirmed_success_after_lifecycle_churn`, do
    not retry; Unity completed the operation and the lifecycle churn is
    informational
12. if `operator_verdict.status=unity_completion_unproven`, inspect the
    surfaced recovery evidence before deciding whether a bounded retry is safe

Mini-playbook after `devmode` with an already-open editor:

1. do not assume the package source switch is active yet just because
   `ensure-ready` reused the live editor
2. run `request-project-refresh --project-root <project>`
3. run `request-status-summary --project-root <project>`
4. if the refresh request crossed lifecycle churn and the wrapper already
   surfaced a `request_id`, run:
   `request-final-status --project-root <project> --request-id <id>`
5. if that compact recovery summary reports:
   - `request_submitted=true`
   - `request_observed_in_unity_journal=false`
   - `bridge_changed_since_submission=true`
   - `operation_outcome=submitted_lost_after_lifecycle_churn`
   treat it as transport submission with incomplete lifecycle proof, then verify
   the effect directly before blind retry
6. only after that move on to compile, tests, or scenario work

PlayMode churn note:

- stale persisted and in-memory test ownership can now be released after
  `request_abandoned` and `request_reclassified`, but the safer operator rule is
  still:
  - recover the last request by `request_id`
  - inspect `result_trust_class`
  - only then decide whether one bounded retry is warranted

Mini-playbook for closeout mismatch:

1. run `restore-editor-state --project-root <project>`
2. if it returns `closeout_classification=quit_ack_without_exit`, treat that as
   "quit was acknowledged but process exit was not proven"
3. run the surfaced `recommended_recovery_command` when present
4. verify remaining project editor PIDs before assuming the editor is gone
5. only after verified exit treat the validation session as fully closed

Compile-first closeout recipe for changed C# scripts:

1. inspect editor state with `request-status-summary --project-root <project>`
2. if the same project editor blocks the batch lane, run the surfaced recovery
   command, usually `request-editor-quit --project-root <project>`
3. verify process exit with `restore-editor-state --project-root <project>` or
   `recover-editor-session --project-root <project>`
4. run the fast batch compile gate
5. only after compile passes, run batch EditMode tests, PlayMode, scenario, or
   GUI smoke validation

Only after that:
- compile
- tests
- play mode
- Game View operations
- scenario runs

## What Is Already Proven

- the service can connect to a real Unity project
- compile can run for explicit targets without switching active platform
- edit-mode tests can run through the bridge
- play mode can be entered and exited
- Game View can be configured and captured
- scenario runs can persist results
- second-wave scenario steps can run and report structured results
- startup helpers can fail fast on interactive compile blockers and package-resolution failures
- host-opened editor sessions can be restored to the original closed state after validation
- baseline smoke orchestration can be reused from this public repo's templates while keeping consumer-specific fixtures host-local
- lifecycle-reset ambiguity can now be resolved from the request journal without manual raw journal digging
- the reusable post-change validation route now runs compile before heavier scenario work
- the public operator contract now prefers summary-first recovery over repeated
  raw result polling when compact surfaces exist
- host-opened editor closeout is now expected to distinguish quit acknowledgement
  from verified process exit instead of treating `unity.editor.quit` success as
  sufficient shutdown proof

## What Is Not Yet Proven

- broad multi-client production use
- stable behavior across a wider Unity version matrix
- device automation
- profiler export and analysis
- runtime bottleneck evidence
- resumable long-running automation
- richer scenario assertions beyond the current core

## Current Risk Areas

- stdio layer still needs hardening
- Game View support still depends on reflection
- deeper project inspection surface is still thin
- no runtime evidence pipeline yet
- no device-side artifact capture yet

## Recommended Next Work

1. harden lifecycle and transport proof:
   - lifecycle fault injection
   - bridge churn recovery proof
   - clearer cancellation and stale-request hygiene
   - explicit closeout truth for host-opened editor sessions
2. add scenario-result utilities:
   - last-result fetch
   - result listing
   - artifact path surfacing
3. harden the scenario lane:
   - richer assertions
   - better result summaries
   - clearer failure taxonomy
4. add first runtime evidence adapters:
   - runtime markers
   - frame or state checkpoints
   - controlled project hook outputs
5. design the device layer on top of scenario control:
   - launch
   - screenshot
   - profiler capture
6. broaden proof across more client and host combinations
7. only then move toward autonomous performance and bottleneck workflows

## Important Non-Goals For The Next Chat

Do not spend time re-evaluating:
- heavy third-party Unity MCP backends as the primary solution
- runtime-in-player MCP packaging
- broad reflection-driven dynamic code execution as the default extension model

Those questions are already settled enough for the current phase.
